<H2>xymon-rclient</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
xymon-rclient is an extension for <a href="http://www.xymon.com/xymon/help/about.html">Xymon</a>
that implements a remote client that
requires no software to be installed on the remote system.  It was developed
to allow execution via remote shell type packages such as rsh, rexec, rlogin
and ssh.  For security reasons, only ssh is recommended.
<P>
This script provides a way to monitor servers that are not directly accessible by
the Xymon display server, or when software cannot be installed or user accounts
cannot be created.  As long as you have a way to run a shell on the remote server,
you should be able to use xymon-rclient to monitor that server.

<H3>Licence</H3>
xymon-rclient is hererby released into the public domain.  Use it however you
need.  It'd be nice if you let me know how well it works for you.
<P>
<B>Disclaimer</B>: xymon-rclient comes with no warranty.  You use this software
at your own risk.  The software might not work as expected, or at all, and that
would be your problem.  The software might cause other things to break.  If you
decide to use it, then you are entirely responsible for anything that happens as
a result.

<H3>Limitations</H3>
Because xymon-rclient it relies only on standard UNIX commands, it does not
fully support the "logfetch" binary (normally provided with a Xymon client).  Thus
log monitoring is only partially supported.  In particular, support for "file:" ignores
"trigger" and "ignore" modifiers, checksumming, and also sends the whole file rather than just
new lines since the last run.  Logfile monitoring support is very new, and care should
be taken to ensure that it works as expected.

<H3>Installation</H3>
Download/view <a href="xymon-rclient.sh">v0.6.1</a> or <a href="changelog">changelog</a>, or <a href="xymon-rclient.sh-v0.6">v0.6</a> or <a href="xymon-rclient.sh-v0.5">v0.5</a> or <a href="xymon-rclient.sh-v0.4">v0.4</a> or <a href="xymon-rclient.sh-v0.3">v0.3</a> or <a href="xymon-rclient.sh-v0.2">v0.2</a> or <a href="xymon-rclient.sh-v0.1">v0.1</a>.
<P>
To install and use, follow the instructions in the comments at the
start of the script.  In brief:
<OL>
<LI>setup non-interactive (eg key) authentication for target hosts
<LI>copy script somewhere
<LI>create a file in <tt>tasks.d/</tt> to launch, or add a section to <tt>tasks.cfg</tt>
<LI>add <tt>RCLIENT</tt> definitions to <tt>hosts.cfg</tt>
</OL>
<P>
Example <tt>hosts.cfg</tt> entries are shown here:
<PRE>
10.99.1.1 remserver1.example.com # testip noping dialup "RCLIENT:cmd(ssh -T otheruser@%{H}),ostype(sunos)"
10.99.1.2 remserver2.example.com # testip noping dialup "RCLIENT:cmd(ssh -T user1@gateway ssh -T -l user1 %{I}),ostype(sunos)"
10.99.1.3 remserver3.example.com # testip noping dialup "RCLIENT:cmd(rsh),ostype(linux),timeout(120)"
10.99.1.4 remserver4.example.com # testip noping dialup "RCLIENT:cmd(ssh -T remserver4.local),ostype(linux),env(TOP=/usr/local/bin/top)"
</PRE>
<P>
The format of the RCLIENT specification in <tt>hosts.cfg</tt> is something like this:
<pre>
RCLIENT:cmd(<cite>command-line</cite>),ostype(<cite>ostype</cite>)[,timeout(<cite>seconds</cite>)][,scriptos(<cite>ostype</cite>)][,env(<cite>var1=val1[ var2=val2 ...]</cite>)]
</pre>
<P>
If spaces are used, the entire <tt>RCLIENT:...</tt> string must be enclosed
in quotes.
<P>
The <tt>cmd()</tt> specifies a command-line to execute in order to
get a shell on the remote system.
The string <tt>%{H}</tt> is automatically replaced by the target hostname.
If a <tt>cmd()</tt> definition has no spaces, then the hostname will be
appended regardless (such as in the "rsh" example above).  The string
<tt>%{I}</tt> is automatically replaced by the IP address in
<cite>hosts.cfg</cite>.  There is no default <tt>cmd()</tt> - it must be
specified.
<P>
The <tt>ostype()</tt> specifies the OS type, and must match one of the
scripts in the client bin directory. For example, specifying
<tt>ostype(<strong>irix</strong>)</tt> will match (and use) the script
<tt>xymonclient-<strong>irix</strong>.sh</tt>.  There is no
default <tt>ostype()</tt> - it must be specified.
<P>
The <tt>scriptos()</tt> specifies the OS type for the script to be sent.
This defaults to the <tt>ostype()</tt> specification.  This is useful if you need
to send a customised script, but the OS of the host matches an existing
script.  Specify only the OS part, so for example, specifying <tt>ostype(sunos)</tt>
and <tt>scriptos(sunos7)</tt> will report a "sunos" server in the client data but
will run the script <tt>xymonclient-sunos7.sh</tt>.
<P>
The default <tt>timeout()</tt> setting is 60 seconds.
<P>
The <tt>env()</tt> setting is useful to specify environment variables
to be given to the client script.  This is useful for defining <tt>TOP</tt>
if it's not in the <tt>PATH</tt>.

<H3>Troubleshooting</H3>
Although designed to be run from <tt>tasks.cfg</tt> or <tt>tasks.d/*.cfg</tt>,
you can run it directly from the command-line.  Give it <tt>-h</tt> for instructions.

<H3>Multi-hop Connections</H3>
Sometimes the target server is not even remotely contactable by hosts that
the Xymon server can connect, and requires multiple connections to get to
a shell prompt the the server to be monitored.  This can be overcome in most
cases, depending on the connectivity.  Here are some examples that might work for you.
<DL>
  <DT>via proxy (requires netcat):</DT>
    <DD><tt>xymon server -[proxy]-> web proxy server -[ssh]-> target server</tt></DD>
    <DD>.ssh/config: <tt>ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x proxyserver:8080 %h %p</tt></DD>
<BR>
  <DT>via another server with ssh, target private key on intermediate server:</DT>
    <DD><tt>xymon server -[ssh]-> intermediate server -[ssh]-> target server</tt></DD>
    <DD>.ssh/config: <tt>ProxyCommand ssh -i .ssh/authkey intermediateservername</tt></DD>
<BR>
  <DT>via another server with ssh, target private key on Xymon server (requires bash):</DT>
    <DD><tt>xymon server ->[tunnel]->( -[ssh]-> intermediate server -[ssh]->)-[ssh]-> target server</tt></DD>
    <DD>.ssh/config: <tt>ProxyCommand ssh -i .ssh/authkey intermediateservername 'exec 3<>/dev/tcp/%h/%p; cat <&3 & cat >&3; kill $!'</tt> (requires <tt>bash</tt>)</DD>
</DL>

<P>
It's useful, and sometimes important to specify the following parameters to ssh connections, either in the cmd() command-line specification, or in the <tt>.ssh/config</tt> file:
<LI><tt>-T</tt> = disable pseudo-terminal allocation
<LI><tt>BatchMode=yes</tt> - prevent ssh from hanging if user input is required (eg key fails and password required)
<LI><tt>-i ~xymon/.ssh/keyfile</tt> (or <tt>IdentityFile</tt>) - specify authentication key

<H3>Other</H3>
xymon-rclient has been used on a Linux display server to monitor Solaris and Linux nodes
and has also been used in various embedded Linux systems.
<P>
Note that (FreeBSD based) FreeNAS appears to run a limited shell by default, which doesn't handle
the client script it's given.  To work around this, add "/bin/bash" to the command like so:
<tt>
<DD>cmd(ssh -T -i /home/xymon/.ssh/xymon-rclient root@%{H} /bin/bash),ostype(freebsd)</DD>
</tt>
